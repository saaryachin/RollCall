# RollCall

RollCall is a lightweight network roll-call tool for quick host presence visibility in homelab and SOC-style environments.

It scans one or more CIDR networks, identifies which hosts are up, optionally resolves them to meaningful names, and presents the results in a clear, table-based format.
